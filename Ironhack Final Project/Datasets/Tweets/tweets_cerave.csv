2866,2022-12-10 19:38:37+00:00,schmidt_happend,@mokuska cerave is the best skincare brand literally i won’t use anything else
2867,2022-12-10 19:38:07+00:00,mokuska,got a sample of a super expensive serum and it tanked my skin. cerave or cetaphil would never do that to me i’m never turning my back on them again
2868,2022-12-10 19:37:44+00:00,WessieHale,@DrBritWilliams @blackgirlinmain Thanks sis! Had never heard about BGS until maybe a year ago. May have to try it once I run out of Cerave in the spring.
2869,2022-12-10 19:35:57+00:00,WessieHale,@Purify_toast17 @blackgirlinmain Same sis. I was an Olay girl from my teen years til about 43 and then switched to Cerave. My skin also rebelled at Olay so it was probably a formulation change. But Cerave is like heaven!
2870,2022-12-10 19:33:30+00:00,WessieHale,@DrBritWilliams @blackgirlinmain Heard good things about Black Girl Sunscreen. I have sensitive skin--is this a good one? I've been using kids' formula versions and just went to Cerave this past summer.
2871,2022-12-10 19:32:16+00:00,WessieHale,"@blackgirlinmain I use Cerave facial lotion with 30SPF daily--from my hairline to my shoulders, front, back and sides of my neck and shoulders too. Need to get a dermatological scan of my body and face just as a baseline, but most folks think I'm easily 10-15 years younger than I am. 49.5yo"
2872,2022-12-10 19:15:30+00:00,tendaironi,@Karnythia I agree with all the comments suggesting an oil cleanser. My face doesn’t feel stripped when I use it and it breaks down all my makeup and sunscreen. I follow up with Cerave’s foaming cleanser. But I also have a whole regimen of serums and CosRx mucin products to moisturize!
2873,2022-12-10 19:09:24+00:00,taymabelitini,"@BeccaLizz two of my faves are the black rice toner from HaruHaru + Cerave moisturizer. salicylic acid can be v good for acne, but you’d have to find a serum rather than a wash, I think? I also love the peach slices acne patches—they do wonders to reduce the time a zit takes up on my face."
2874,2022-12-10 18:50:25+00:00,Blackwomangold,"@karissachen Have you tried avocado oil (which penetrates the skin layers) or Cerave moisturizers which can be found in many stores and recommended by dermatologists? I would also recommend Shea and/or Cocoa butters, unrefined and applied multiple times throughout the day to the scar."
2875,2022-12-10 18:26:32+00:00,FleetwoodMak,@MmmMicrobes The face wash can actually penetrate deeper into your pores and clean them out. So you can use whatever face wash works for you and then moisturize after (I use vitamin e oil and then cerave hyaluronic acid serum). 2/2

I get it bad around my mouth, and creams hurt SO bad. I don't get that with the oil, and I use a generous amount and just wipe some off as needed."
6875,2022-11-10 17:23:38+00:00,ThisOrTheOtter,"@therealchucko I used to use Nivea, but I'm moving into CeraVe instead."
6876,2022-11-10 17:22:58+00:00,yeslahgraveyard,"@hotmothgf I also really like @herbivorebeauty and doing a combination of oil and moisturizer. For dryness and breakouts, I do the Emerald Deep Oil and either the Cerave or Herbivore Pink Cloud cream. The oil is REALLY nice when your skin is burning and irritating. It doesn't burn dry skin."
6877,2022-11-10 17:21:11+00:00,ThomasTheTwunk,@confusedotter @jpegtears I hear what you are saying — but they’ve became one of the most used cleansing brands worldwide. For the average person there isn’t going to be any irritation. Ceravè as a brand are a very safe choice for majority of people. LRP not so much due to their more complex formulas.
6878,2022-11-10 17:20:02+00:00,yeslahgraveyard,"@hotmothgf I feel like this is a dumb one, but have you tried Cerave? When I was going through a strange adult acne phase, this is what the dermatologist had me use, and I continue to use it. I still get dryness, but it's hard to keep that at bay in Minnesota."
6879,2022-11-10 17:18:01+00:00,confusedotter,"@ThomasTheTwunk @jpegtears HA, ceramics and peptides can be irritating. but, i can generally use them fine. cerave use their own patented delivery system, it’s probably because of that."
6880,2022-11-10 17:16:17+00:00,ThomasTheTwunk,@confusedotter @jpegtears I just don’t see what ingredient in Ceravè causes these chemical burns — when all of the brands you mention have the same ingredients in their cleansers. 🤡
6881,2022-11-10 17:14:34+00:00,confusedotter,@ThomasTheTwunk @jpegtears dr dray did a video on it cos it keeps popping up with cerave! but if it works for you it works for you :)
6882,2022-11-10 17:13:46+00:00,ThomasTheTwunk,@confusedotter @jpegtears Personally I wouldn’t recommend LPR for cleansers as some of them have fragrance in which is more likely to cause irritation than any of the cleanser offering from Ceravè. Longer ingredients list as well = more potential for irritation.
6883,2022-11-10 17:12:25+00:00,ThomasTheTwunk,"@confusedotter @jpegtears All brands have potential for irritation it’s just the nature of skincare. First I’ve seen of the cleansers causing issue with Ceravè though, usually it’s the moisturisers due to the urea."

6885,2022-11-10 17:06:47+00:00,ThomasTheTwunk,"@confusedotter @jpegtears There’s a few different hydrating cleansers from Cerave. And ah, I disagree. I’ve tried high end cleansers to the lowest end I’ve never found any that I prefer to Ceravè."
6886,2022-11-10 17:04:32+00:00,confusedotter,"@ThomasTheTwunk @jpegtears yeah, i thought it was just me but upon googling it’s weirdly common w Cerave (esp the hydrating cleanser). a lot of ppl still love it though but literally everyone has heard of it at this point, there are better alternatives out there imo"

I use O'Keefe's ""Working Feet"" cream, as it works to soften calluses and help heal cracking skin. CeraVe and Eucerin are also good brands for the money. 

Colloidal oatmeals soaks twice a week will help repair and moisturize broken skin as well.

12558,2022-10-02 02:08:04+00:00,Iacoguy,@DestinySugarB @bouffantbecky That is something I'm unsure of. The retinol is going to encourage your skin to produce more collagen on its own. I use prescription strength retin-a and I just use cerave because that's what my dermatologist recommended

14557,2022-09-23 01:48:48+00:00,floyourchef,@Oyinlola_B @cerave Okayyy
14558,2022-09-23 01:46:29+00:00,Spy_soup,@twistCMYK Cerave and The Ordinary are great simple yet effective brands. If you cannot stand white cast tho I'd spring for a better sunscreen. Supergoop is expensive but it's not oily.More affordable but still good sunscreens are Sunbum(for the face)and  Neutrogena Invisible Daily Defense

CeraVe makes a cheaper mineral SPF, although you might want to get the tinted version if you’re particularly tan as oxides can leave a white cast

18875,2022-08-27 11:11:02+00:00,Emma_h_mua,@Ms_Deathwish Plain vaseline. It won't sting/not nearly as much. It'll help protect the skin. When the flakiness subsides a bit id recommend cetaphil or cerave moisturisers. They have ceramides which help repair the skin and don't have irritants that could make it worse.
