## Sentiment Analysis on L'oreal Active Cosmetics Line
### Final Project - Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Overview
L'Oreal Group is a French multinational corporation that produces cosmetics and personal care products, and which owns 4 different product lines. For this Sentiment Analysis project, I focused on their Active Cosmetics line, which is made up of five different brands: Cerave, Decleor, La Roche Posay, Skinceuticals and Vichy. The main objective of this exercise is to gather valuable insights that will guide the company's strategic decision-making processes.

## Procedure
### 1- Products Scraping and Tweepy 
To carry out the Sentiment Analysis, I obtained tweets from the last three years mentioning each of the brands (January 2020 - January 2023). In total, approximately 100,000 tweets were obtained. The tecniques used fot this first step were:
- Web Scraping
- APIS: Tweepy

### 2- Ngram Analysis
Afterwards, I proceeded with the Sentiment Analysis. For this purpose, I conducted an #Ngram Analysis, a powerful tool that can be used by businesses to gain insights into trends and patterns in language use. The tecniques used were:
- Data Cleaning
- NLTK and Sklearn libraries

### 3- LDA Models
Finally, I went further and used a machine learning model that takes sentiment analysis to another level. This is #LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) analysis, a machine learning technique that is commonly used for topic modeling. Library used:
- pyLDAvis
