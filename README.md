# Sentiment Analysis on L'oreal Active Cosmetics 
Final Project - Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Process
L'oreal is a global company with 4 different product lines. For this project, I focused on their Active Cosmetics line, which is made up of five different brands: Cerave, Decleor, La Roche Posay, Skinceuticals and Vichy.

To carry out the Sentiment Analysis, I obtained tweets from the last three years mentioning each of the brands (January 2020 - January 2023). In total, approximately 100,000 tweets were obtained via Twitter's API. 

Then, I proceeded with the Sentiment Analysis. For this purpose, I conducted an #Ngram Analysis, a powerful tool that can be used by businesses to gain insights into trends and patterns in language use. Ngrams are essentially sequences of words, and ngram analysis involves analyzing the frequency of occurrence of these sequences in a corpus of text. 

Finally, I went further and used a machine learning model that takes sentiment analysis to another level. This is #LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) analysis, a machine learning technique that is commonly used for topic modeling. It can be used by businesses to identify and categorize topics that are present in a large corpus of text data.
